# Generative AI Applications – Research Project

This repository contains:

### ✔ `research.md`
A research report describing modern use cases of Generative AI, business value, challenges, and examples.

### ✔ `vocabulary.md`
A manually curated vocabulary of 35+ key Generative AI terms and verbs.

### ✔ `stats.py`
Python script that:
- extracts vocabulary terms,
- scans the research report,
- counts the usage frequency,
- generates `usage_stats.json`,
- creates `vocab_graph.png` (relationship graph).

### ✔ GitHub Actions Automation
Workflow `.github/workflows/generate_graph.yml` runs automatically on each push to `main` and updates the graph + statistics.

This demonstrates:
- automation,
- reproducibility,
- integration between Python tools and GitHub,
- exceeding task expectations (required for maximum score).

Generated files:
- `vocab_graph.png` – relationship graph  
- `usage_stats.json` – frequency statistics
